# AmplitudeModulation_3-1_Project
Amplitude modulation (AM) is a widely used technique for transmitting and receiving voice signals over long distances. In this technique, the amplitude of a high-frequency carrier signal is varied in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of the voice signal. The modulated signal is then transmitted through the communication channel, and at the receiver, the original voice signal is extracted by demodulating the received signal. Here we Implemented DSB(Double-sideband) signal transmission & Direct Conversion Receiver(DCR) based signal reception.Before implementing the hardware we simulated our whole system using Eagle Schematics software .This process helped us to predict any overlooked faults in our circuit design and to optimize the process furthermore. After finalizing the design we developed the actual hardware for the system and compared its output with our simulation results .In order to generalize the process more we designed a variable frequency oscillator instead of a fixed carrier generator .This will help us to further develop and improve our system in the future.
